                <p>Gentlemen, a short view back to the past. Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us ‘take a monkey, place
                    him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.’ Thirty years later, Sebastian told us ‘I had
                    to start my car like a computer, it’s very complicated.’ And Nico Rosberg said that during the race
                    – I don’t remember what race – he pressed the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you both: is
                    Formula One driving today too complicated with twenty and more buttons on the wheel, are you too
                    much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future concerning the technical
                    programme during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more communication with your engineers?
