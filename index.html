                        him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.’ Thirty years later, Sebastian told us ‘I
                        had
                        to start my car like a computer, it’s very complicated.’ And Nico Rosberg said that during the

                        – I don’t remember what race – he pressed the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you both:
                        is
                        Formula One driving today too complicated with twenty and more buttons on the wheel, are you too

                        programme during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more communication with your
                        engineers?
